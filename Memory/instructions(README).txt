Enjoy :)


How to play Memory:

Mix up the cards.
Lay them in rows, face down.
Turn over any two cards.
If the two cards match, keep them.
If they don't match, turn them back over.
Remember what was on each card and where it was.
The game is over when all the cards have been matched.


Test Cases:

Manual Testing: Input validation and core functionality works


Edge Cases:

As long as the input is valid for each pick of a card, there are no test cases to cover.


Programming Language:

Python. I chose this because it is not only my favorite and strongest programming language, but it also is very intuitive and the easiest (in my opinion) to implement things in.


Libraries:

The random number library to randomize the cards.
The time library to pause the game and allow the users to remember the cards positions after they flipper them.
